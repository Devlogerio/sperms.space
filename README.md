This is the race of life! Race as sperm in a vagina with hundreds of other players, try to reach the egg, and name your baby! This is an online multiplayer .io game.

## How to play
Enter your name and the name of the baby you want and hit play, you will start with 100hp out of 200 and 3 boost powers, you need 200hp in order to enter the eggshell so be careful because colliding with the vagina cells will cost you hp! the first sperm enters the egg the race will end and restart, and the name of the body and his/her father will be saved in database and can be seen, The more babies you have, the higher score you get on the leader board!...

## About the making
This game is made by Nodejs/Javascript/Socket.io/HTML5/P5js/Victorjs/WEBGL?Mongodb, This is a 3D game working made to compete with newer and more advanced .io game genre, mostly with 3d .io games.
NOTE: MongoDB is the database but it has been commented on due to the ease of use of the code for the others, The Leaderboard for the game will be up and running as soon as possible.

## About the versions:
Every single change is submitted and documented as files and backups on my backup hard drives, If you have any request or question about previous versions of this game or any other of my games, you should call me, I am unable to document every single of my changes on GitHub so everything is backed up other places and only the final version/versions are here.

## Reason of being open source
Github private repository is forbidden in my country so I decided to make all of my games open source for public
