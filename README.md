This is the race of life! Race as an sperm in a vagina with hundreds of other players, try to reach the egg and name your baby! This is an online multiplayer .io game.

## How to play
Enter your name and the name of baby you want and hit play, you will start with 100hp out of 200 and 3 boost powers, you need 200hp in order to enter the egg shell so be careful because colliding with the vagina cells will cost you hp! the first sperm enters the egg the race will end and restart, the name of the bady and his/her father will be saved in dattabase and can be seen, more babies you have, higher score you got on the leader board!...

NOTE: Mongodb is the database but its been commented due to the easy to use of the code for the others, the Leaderboard for the game will be up and running as soon as possible.
