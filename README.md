This is the race of life! Race as sperm in a vagina with hundreds of other players, try to reach the egg, and name your baby! This is an online multiplayer .io game.

## How to play
Enter your name and the name of the baby you want and hit play, you will start with 100hp out of 200 and 3 boost powers, you need 200hp in order to enter the eggshell so be careful because colliding with the vagina cells will cost you hp! the first sperm enters the egg the race will end and restart, and the name of the body and his/her father will be saved in database and can be seen, The more babies you have, the higher score you get on the leader board!...
